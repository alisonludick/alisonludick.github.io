                    <h4>I had no idea...</h4>
                    <p>
                        I naively thought that learning to code would simply be about the actual writing of code. 
                        Little did I know that there was actually a whole slew of <strong>vitally important</strong> things that 
                        were required before the very first line of code could be written. 
                        The mind map above will give you an idea of what I'm referring to, and the articles below will provide
                        the details of my journey, and pre-journey as I like to think of it, of <strong>Learning To Code</strong>.
