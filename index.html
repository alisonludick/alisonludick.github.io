                <h4>I had no idea...</h4>
                <p>
                    I naively thought that learning to code would simply be about the actual writing of code. 
                    Little did I know that there was actually a whole slew of <strong>vitally important</strong> things that 
                    were required before the very first line of code could be written.

                    The mind map above will give you an idea of what I'm referring to, and the articles below will provide
                    the details of my journey, and pre-journey as I like to think of it, of <strong>Learning To Code</strong>.

                    Back-End?

                <h4>What coding language will you choose</h4>
                <p>
                    HTML and CSS?
                    JavaScript?
                    There are so many languages to choose from. It was helpful when I was seeking advice, to have it explained which
                    languages serve which purpose. I learned that HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used in Front-End development, and 
                    that there were other languages used for Back-End. Therefore, deciding which language to study depends, largely, on
                    what kind of a developer you want to become.

                <h4>Where will you get trained?</h4>
                <p>
                    There are so many options out there. You will need to decide if you want to pay for tuition or  find 
                    courses online that are free. Will you enroll in a coding bootcamp, which can last anywhere from 10 weeks
                    to 24 weeks, or would you prefer to take individual courses at your own pace? Would being on campus suit 
                    you better than a distance learning option? These, and many other things will need to be taken into consideration.

                <h4>How to prepare your machine</h4>
                <p>
                    What operating system do I use? And what version? What text editor should I use? 
                    I had no idea was a text editor even was but I have a friend who is a senior software engineer, who sent me a very helpful email
                    giving advice about these things. He suggested Visual Studio Code, so that's the one I went for. 
                    Never underestimate the value of asking those who have the relevant experience and know-how. 
                    I discovered that, because I have a Macbook with Yosemite, version 10.10.5, I needed to download the appropriate version of VSCode.
                    I have since had it automatically updated so now I'm working on Version 1.21.0-insider, and it is working well for me!
                    I was also advised to download Git and, again, because of my version of Mac, I had to download an older version. The error message
                    I got when I installed the latest version said "no mountable file systems" (no idea?!) and I had to investigate what that meant. 
                    I realised I needed an older version of Git. It took me quite a while to figure this out but I eventually found what I needed here: 
                    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">SourceForge.</a> There were also some helpful folks in the GitHub 
                    community who shared this same source. That wasn't the end of it. As I started taking some modules on HTML and CSS at 
                    <a href="https://www.edx.org/microsoft-professional-program-front-end-development ">edX</a>, I was unable to run something called Sass and, 
                    again, I reached out to the coding community on social media (FYI: Twitter is an excellent place to get your questions answered!), and someone 
                    was kind enough to advise that I needed something called <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> to run Sass. He said: "Apple has a nasty habit
                    of not installing Dev headers for things." He said I should install Homebrew and then install its version of Ruby and that would enable me
                    to run Sass. He added: "This will then put an up to date copy of Ruby in /usr/local/bin/ruby and add to your path. This copy has the 
                    missing headers available." Can I just say how grateful I am for people who know more than I do, who are willing to share their knowledge? Yikes!
                    I still don't know what he meant by all that, but I am sure am thankful that I have been able to proceed with learning code because of the help
                    of others. </br>
                    <strong>Update, Feb 11:</strong> After using Brew to install Ruby, I got this message: files have been installed to /usr/local/Cellar/ruby/2.5.0 and 
                    Emacs Lisp files have been installed to /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/ruby. </br>
                    <strong>Update, Feb 12:</strong> There's more! I now need to uninstall node and sass, and reinstall them using Homebrew. It seems like a potentially complicated
                    thing, so I'm approaching with caution and will update my progress. </br>
                    <strong>Update, Feb 14:</strong> Two sites which were invaluable in fixing the nodejs and npm installations (and uninstallations!)

                <h4>How to showcase what you're learning or building</h4>
                <p>
                    Should I use GitHub? What is GitHub?
                    Or Codepen?
                    Should I buy my own domain name? And hosting service?
                    I searched extensively, I asked for advice on different social media platforms. I was eventually able to 
                    narrow it down to either GitHub or Codepen, with GitHub being the more popular of the two. So I started reading 
                    a book called Pro Git which is available as a free download <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">here</a>, as well as the 
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Git-Scott-Chacon-ebook/dp/B01ISNIKES/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1518217342&sr=8-1&keywords=pro+git ">free Kindle version here</a>. Though I think it is an excellent resource, it was still way above
                    my head. I finally stumbled across <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/" target="_blank">this site</a>, 
                    for which I will be forever grateful, because the easy-to-follow 
                    instructions made this site possible.
