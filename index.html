                    <h4>I had no idea...</h4>
                    <p>
                        I naively thought that learning to code would simply be about the actual writing of code. 
                        Little did I know that there was actually a whole slew of <strong>vitally important</strong> things that 
                        were required before the very first line of code could be written. 
                        The mind map above will give you an idea of what I'm referring to, and the articles below will provide
                        the details of my journey, and pre-journey as I like to think of it, of <strong>Learning To Code</strong>.

                    <h4>Where will you get trained?</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are so many options out there. You will need to decide if you want to pay for tuition or  find 
                        courses online that are free. Will you enroll in a coding bootcamp or would you prefer to take individual
                        courses? Would being on campus suit you better than a distance learning option? These, and many other things
                        will need to be taken into consideration.

                    <p>
                        What operating system do I use? And what version? 
                        What text editor should I use? 
                        What else do I need to do before I can code?

                    <h4>How to showcase what you're learning or building</h4>
                    <p>
                        Should I use GitHub? What is GitHub?
                        Or Codepen?
                        Should I buy my own domain name? And hosting service?
                        I searched extensively, I asked for advice on different social media platforms. I was eventually able to 
                        narrow it down to either GitHub or Codepen, with GitHub being the more popular of the two. So I started reading 
                        a book called Pro Git which is available as a free download <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">here<a/>, as well as the 
                        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Git-Scott-Chacon-ebook/dp/B01ISNIKES/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1518217342&sr=8-1&keywords=pro+git ">free Kindle version here<a/>. Though I think it is an excellent resource, it was still way above
                        my head. I finally stumbled across <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/" target="_blank">this site</a>, 
                        for which I will be forever grateful, because the easy-to-follow 
                        instructions made this site possible.
